## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Description

This agentic AI system leverages **advanced NLP models** to:

- Detect similar clauses across contracts
- Identify inconsistencies or contradictions
- Extract key legal entities (names, dates, obligations) using **NER**

The **agentic architecture** enables autonomous navigation, analysis, and summarization of documents, reducing manual review time.

---

## üîç Problem

Legal documents are often:

- Complex, dense, and redundant
- Time-consuming to review manually
- Prone to human error, especially across jurisdictions

Traditional tools lack **contextual sensitivity**, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

---

## üí° Solution

This tool provides a **sophisticated, autonomous solution**:

- Fine-tuned **Legal-BERT** for domain-specific NER
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for clause comparison and contextual analysis
- Agentic AI for autonomous document navigation and summarization
- Integration-ready for legal workflows and DMS systems

---

## üß† Training Process

### Preprocessing

- Collected a large legal corpus: contracts, filings, case law, annotated documents
- Cleaned text and normalized terminology
- Segmented documents into **clause-level units**
- Manually annotated parties, dates, obligations, statutes, financial terms

### Model Selection

- Base model: **BERT**, fine-tuned on legal text (Legal-BERT variant)
- RAG integrated for external document referencing and clause similarity
- Human-in-the-loop feedback to enhance output relevance

### Training & Validation

- Supervised learning on annotated NER dataset (80/20 train/validation split)
- Co-training for RAG: retrieval + generation alignment
- Iterative feedback from legal professionals

### Evaluation Metrics

- **NER:** Precision, Recall, F1-score
- **Clause similarity/contradiction:** Semantic similarity + manual validation
- **RAG retrieval:** Top-k accuracy, BLEU scores
